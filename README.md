# Filter Project Backend

This repository contains the backend of the Filter Project, a water filter maintenance application built with Node.js and Express.

## Overview

The backend manages the application's data and provides an API for the frontend to interact with. It's built using Express, with SQLite3 for the database. CORS is implemented for handling cross-origin requests.

To get the full functionality of the application, you'll need to have the frontend running as well. The frontend can be found at this repository: [Filter Project Frontend](https://github.com/patcont/filter-project)
